# Markdown Previewer

I built this markdown previewer using [React](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJ58jn9-7cAhXSzVMKHfEUCdYQFjAAegQIABAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Freactjs.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw26YbpVhaFnAB4A6G8-4uAs) and [marked.js](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-_7j39-7cAhXStlMKHRAEAAsQFjAAegQIBRAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmarkedjs%2Fmarked&usg=AOvVaw1JBUcpcl9VZRjPdhQPzYCL). The goal of this was to familiarize myself with the React ecosystem. While not the most robust or comprehensive project, it was a decent introduction in to the world of React that will help scaffold my learning. For the aforementioned reasons this project *is not* responsive. It was built for larger devices greater than 960 reference pixels.

Go ahead and create comprehensive and well formatted documentation for your projects!

## Built With

* React.js
* Marked.js
* create-react-app
* SCSS


## Final Thoughts

React is interesting. When devtools are open and you type only the DOM elements that were modified are replaced, which is evidence of React's virtual DOM in action. I can instantly understand how/why React is so popular; I could do this myself using vanilla JavaScript but React abstracts away a lot of this menial work so you can focus on the more important development tasks.


## Acknowledgements

* [freeCodeCamp's tutorial](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react) on React was extremely helpful for getting my feet wet with the basics of react

* Create react app is great -- SCSS support, webpack is already configured, live-reloading etc. It's super simple to get up and running with very little configuration required

* [gitname's tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) for pushing a create-react-app to github pages was helpful
